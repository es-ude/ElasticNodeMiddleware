# Installation

The following tools have to be installed for using the elasticnode middleware code. 

## Bazel

For building and testing our code we use the tool [Bazel](https://www.bazel.build/).
For using the elastic node middleware code, you need to install bazel.
The installation is explained on the website [bazel installation](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/2.2.0/install.html).
As declared in the .bazelversion file, we use the bazel version 3.1.0.
Please install the right version.
If you use an IDE, you can check on the [bazel website for IDEs](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/2.2.0/ide.html), if your IDE can integrate bazel as a plugin.

## Python

For uploading a bitfile to the FPGA we use python scripts. 
Therefore, you need to install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
Please use the python version 3 instead of python version 2. 

## Screen

For communication purposes we use the full-screen window manager [screen](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/).

## Docker

If you want to use the code with docker like explained in the file [Docker](Docker.md) and your operating system does not include Docker, you have to install it.
The installation is described at the [docker website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

## Github Repository

The elastic node middleware code is uploaded in a [github repository](https://github.com/es-ude/ElasticNodeMiddleware).
